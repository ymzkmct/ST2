Image2Base64
===========================

#### [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)

## About
This is a Sublime Text 2 plugin allowing you to open images as converted to base64.

## Usage
Just click on image file in sidebar and it will be opened as base64 code.
**Never save images as base64 code.**

## Install
### Package Controll

The easiest way to install this is with [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime\_packages/package\_control).

 * If you just went and installed Package Control, you probably need to restart Sublime Text 2 before doing this next bit.
 * Bring up the Command Palette (Command+Shift+p on OS X, Control+Shift+p on Linux/Windows).
 * Select "Package Control: Install Package" (it'll take a few seconds)
 * Select Image2Base64 when the list appears.

Package Control will automatically keep Git up to date with the latest version.

### Alternative
Drop Image2Base64.py file to Sublime's user packages directory and restart Sublime Text 2.
